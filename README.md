Monitoring Kubernetes Clusters - a webinar for DEV.BG held on 30.07.2024 

## Supporting files
Files are provided in the following structure:
* *demo* folder contains the supporting manifests files and the actual demo steps
* *slides.pdf* file contains the slides of the presentation

## Requirements
A station with installed ***kubectl*** and ***helm*** binaries, and access to ***three*** Kubernetes clusters. The demo environment configuration looks like this:

The actual demonstration used three Kubernetes clusters created with ***kubeadm***, each having one control plane node and two worker nodes. Of course, a simpler/lighter environment could be used or one created with other means. Depending on the difference, the demo script/steps may need some adjustment.
